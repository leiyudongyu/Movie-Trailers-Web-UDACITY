# Project 1: Movie Trailer Website
This is a Movie trailer website project of Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree in Udacity
In this project, I have wrote server-side code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. 
The web page I created allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the trailers.

1. Run movie_trailer_center.py then you will have 4 commends on the screen.
