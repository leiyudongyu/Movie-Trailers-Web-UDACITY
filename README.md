# Project 1: Movie Trailer Website

This is a Movie trailer website project of Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree in Udacity

In this project, I have wrote server-side code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. 

The web page I created allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the trailers.

1. Run movie_trailer_center.py then you will have 4 commends on the screen.

 a is to add your favorite movie trailer.
 b is to remove a movie in the movie list by movie name. 
 c is to generate and show a webpage for the movies you add. 
 d is to exit.

2. After you finishing adding movies, you can imput c to generate html file and you can see the web page like below.
